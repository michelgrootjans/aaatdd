Goal
----
This is a simple application demonstrating the following designs/practices:
- BDD with AAA test structure
- Container
- Repository pattern with implementation Fluent NHibernate
- Explore if different UI technologies could be applied with the same implementation (WinForms, asp.net, MVC, WPF, Silverlight)

Functionality
-------------
This application could be used inside a company. The general idea is as follows:
- an emplyee arrives at work in the morning. He opens up the application and adds a request for a snack (e.g. a Club Sandwich)
- at 10:00 AM, the secretary opens up the application and prints out all requests. (S)he orders all the requested snacks from the snack shop.
- at noon, when the snacks arive, everybody's happy ;-)

The application should allow every employee to request a snack. The requests have to be deduced from their account.
The application should allow a secretary to print out the requests of the day.

Bugs
----
1) Cannot find user in the repository
To reproduce: 
- start the winforms app with the InMemoryRepository
- prepopulate the repository with a user with id 1
Result:
- user Id 1 cannot be found in the repository
